⚖️ Constitutional Answer:
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if there's a law against employing a child under 14 in a hazardous industry. The user mentioned they were employed in such a situation, so I need to check the provided articles to see if any of them address this issue.

Looking through the articles, I see Article 24 is titled "Prohibition of employment of children in factories, etc." That sounds relevant. Let me read it. It says, "No child below the age of fourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment." So, this directly prohibits employing children under 14 in factories, mines, or any hazardous work.

I should also check if there are any exceptions or other related articles. Article 23 talks about forced labor but doesn't specifically address child employment. Article 15 deals with discrimination and has provisions for special treatments for women and children, but it doesn't directly prohibit child labor. Article 17 is about untouchability, and Article 276 is about taxes, so those aren't relevant here.

Therefore, the only article that applies is Article 24, which clearly prohibits such employment. So, the answer should cite Article 24 and explain its provisions.

The law prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 in hazardous industries. 

**Answer:**
Yes, there is a law against this. Article 24 of the Constitution explicitly states that no child below the age of fourteen years shall be employed in any factory, mine, or other hazardous employment. Therefore, your employment in such conditions is prohibited under the law.
