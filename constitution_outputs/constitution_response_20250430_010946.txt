⚖️ Constitutional Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to help someone who's facing interference from the state government while planning a Shiva puja in their locality. They're Hindu and part of a committee organizing this event. They want some legal help, so I need to figure out how the Constitution of India protects their rights in this situation.

First, I remember that the Constitution has articles related to freedom of religion. Article 25 comes to mind. It says that all persons have the freedom to profess, practice, and propagate religion, subject to public order, morality, and health. So, as long as their puja doesn't disrupt public order or go against morality or health, they should be protected.

I should check the exact wording of Article 25. It mentions that the freedom is subject to public order, morality, and health, and other provisions in Part III. So, the state can't interfere unless it's for these reasons. The user didn't mention any issues related to public order, so the state's interference might not be justified.

Also, Article 25(2)(b) talks about the state making laws for social welfare and reform, including opening Hindu institutions to all Hindus. But in this case, the committee is just organizing a puja, not managing an institution, so this part might not apply directly.

I don't see any other articles in the provided list that relate to religious freedom. The other articles are about electoral matters, union territories, and special provisions for Andhra Pradesh, which don't seem relevant here.

So, the main point is Article 25. The user can argue that their right to practice religion is being unfairly interfered with, and the state doesn't have a valid reason under the article to stop them. They should probably consult a lawyer to challenge the state's interference based on Article 25.

The right to freely profess, practice, and propagate religion is protected under Article 25 of the Constitution of India. According to Article 25(1), all persons, including Hindus, are entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice, and propagate religion, subject to public order, morality, and health. 

If the state government's interference is not based on considerations of public order, morality, or health, it may be violating your constitutional rights. You may seek legal recourse to challenge such interference, citing Article 25. It is advisable to consult a legal expert to explore your options further.
