Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if a state-run educational institution can deny someone admission just because of their religion. The user is from a minority community and was denied admission solely on religious grounds. I need to check the provided articles to see what the Constitution says about this.

First, I remember that Article 15 deals with prohibition of discrimination. Let me look at that. Article 15(1) says the State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. So, that seems relevant because the denial is based on religion.

Then, Article 15(2) talks about not subjecting citizens to disabilities based on those grounds regarding access to educational institutions maintained by the State. So, if the institution is state-run, they can't deny admission based on religion.

Also, Article 29(2) specifically mentions that no citizen shall be denied admission to a state-maintained or aided educational institution solely on the grounds of religion, race, caste, language, etc. That directly applies here because the user was denied admission based on religion.

So, putting it together, both Article 15 and Article 29 protect against such discrimination. The institution can't deny admission just because of the user's religion. They have the right to equal access under these provisions.

The state-run educational institution cannot deny you admission solely based on your religion. According to Article 15(1) and Article 15(2), the State is prohibited from discriminating against any citizen on grounds of religion, and no citizen can be denied access to state-maintained educational institutions based on such grounds. Additionally, Article 29(2) explicitly states that no citizen shall be denied admission to an educational institution maintained by the State or receiving State aid on the basis of religion, race, caste, language, or any other specified grounds. Therefore, the denial of admission based solely on your religion is unconstitutional.
