‚öñÔ∏è Constitutional Answer:
<think>
Okay, so the user is asking if being detained by the police for 48 hours without being produced before a magistrate is allowed. I need to check the provided articles to see what the Constitution says about this.

Looking at Article 22, which deals with protection against arrest and detention. Clause (2) specifically mentions that every person arrested must be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours, excluding travel time. So, 48 hours is way beyond that limit.

But wait, there's an exception in clause (3). It says that these protections don't apply to enemy aliens or those under preventive detention. The user didn't mention anything about preventive detention, so I assume that's not the case here.

So, according to Article 22(2), the police should have produced the user before a magistrate within 24 hours. Since it's been 48 hours, this seems to be a violation of their rights under the Constitution.

I should make sure there's no other article that might override this. The other articles provided don't seem relevant here. Article 233A is about district judges, Article 220 about judges practicing after retirement, and Article 361 about immunity for the President and Governors. Article 373 talks about preventive detention but only until Parliament makes provisions, which they have, so it doesn't affect this case.

Therefore, the detention beyond 24 hours without magistrate production is not allowed under Article 22(2).

Under Article 22(2) of the Constitution of India, every person who is arrested and detained in custody must be produced before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours of such arrest. Since you have been detained for 48 hours without being produced before a magistrate, this is a violation of your constitutional rights. You may seek legal recourse to challenge this detention.
